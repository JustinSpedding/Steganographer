This program hides and retrieves files inside images via steganography (least significant bit method).
It can also analyze images to see how likely it is that they contain a stego.

For Encoding:
Host Image = The path to the image that the stego will be hidden inside
Stego Path = The path to the stego (The stego is the file to be hidden inside the image)
Output Image = The path to the new image that will be created with the stego hidden inside
Press the 'Generate Preview' button to generate a preview of what the host image would look like after being encoded.
Press the 'Encode' button to start encoding.
You can encode the stego using a password so that it can only be decoded by someone who knows the password.

For Decoding:
Host Image = The path to the image that the stego will be decoded from
Output Directory = The directory in which to store the stego after it has been decoded from the host image
Press the 'Update' button at the bottom of the window.
Press the 'Decode' button to start decoding.
You can use a password to decode a stego if it was encoded with the same password.

For Analyzing:
Host Image = The path to the image to analyze
Press the 'Analyze' button at the bottom of the window to analyze the host image for a stego.
Please note that steganalysis is NOT 100% accurate.
